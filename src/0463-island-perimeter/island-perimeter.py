# You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
#
# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
#
# The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
#

# Example:
#
#
# Input:
# [[0,1,0,0],
#  [1,1,1,0],
#  [0,1,0,0],
#  [1,1,0,0]]
#
# Output: 16
#
# Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
